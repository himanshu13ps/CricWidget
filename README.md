Source code for IPL Live score widget created in 2012

The app was initially created in Eclipse with ADT. It has been migrated to Android Studio environment. 

The app can be found @
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hps 

It no more works though, it was taken off as advised by BCCI. IPL scores cannot be published within 15 minutes of Live 
as this has been copyrighted by BCCI. 

Till then, it was a great ride for me though to create my first public app and learn a lot of Android concepts in the process.
